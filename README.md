# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used for this project is the UCI Sonar dataset, which contains 60 features extracted from sonar signals.

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

* Loaded and explored the dataset, including checking for missing values and data types.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the data, such as data distributions and potential correlations.
* Preprocessed the data by scaling the features using StandardScaler to ensure consistent feature scales.

**2. Model Building and Evaluation:**

* Trained various classification models, including:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
* Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
* Performed hyperparameter tuning for each model using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize their performance.

**3. Conclusion:**

* Summarize the project's findings and potential areas for future improvement, such as:
    * Exploring more advanced machine learning models (e.g., deep learning models).
    * Feature engineering to extract more informative features from the raw sonar data.
    * Collecting more data to improve model generalization.

**4. Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
